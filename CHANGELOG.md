## [UNRELEASED]

* Closed #43: Fixed an issue where widgets would sometimes not load in a dynamic UI context. (#91, #93)
* Closed #94: New `SHINYWIDGETS_CDN` and `SHINYWIDGETS_CDN_ONLY` environment variables were added to more easily specify the CDN provider. Also, the default provider has changed from <unpkg.com> to <cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm> (#95)
* A warning is no longer issued (by default) when the path to a local widget extension is not found. This is because, if an internet connection is available, the widget assests are still loaded via CDN. To restore the previous behavior, set the `SHINYWIDGETS_EXTENSION_WARNING` environment variable to `"true"`. (#95)
* Closed #14: Added a `bokeh_dependency()` function to simplify use of bokeh widgets. (#85)
* Closed #89: Exported the `as_widget()` function to attempt coercion of objects into ipywidgets. Internally, `{shinywidgets}` uses it to implictly coerce objects into ipywidgets, but it can be also useful to explicitly coerce objects before passing to `register_widget()` (so that the ipywidget can then be updated in-place and/or used as a reactive value (`reactive_read()`)). (#90)
